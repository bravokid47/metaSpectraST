metaSpectraST is an unsupervised and database-independent analysis tools for metaproteomic MS/MS data using spectrum clustering. It clusters all experimentally observed MS/MS spectra based on their spectral similarity and create a representative consensus spectrum for each cluster by using the spectrum clustering algorithm implemented in the spectral library search engine, [SpectraST](http://tools.proteomecenter.org/wiki/index.php?title=Software:SpectraST).
